<h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium text-center title-font text-gray-900 mb-4"><b><u><em>Why we need AI?</em></u></b></h1>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed xl:w-2/4 lg:w-3/4 mx-auto">We people in today's world have been hearing the word artificial Intelligence.  But most of the people don’t know exactly what does this Artificial Intelligence means? and moreover why it is necessary in today's world. But today the people do not know that this Artificial Intelligence has been everywhere in today world. For every decade, the population is being increased in an unexpected way. And the hidden fact that we need to know is that we were already using the Artificial Intelligence. But the people still think that term is new and we need to apply. And the major reason for why do we need artificial Intelligence is that because of the population.<br>



So do you think that population is the reason for involvement of Artificial Intelligence? Yes, because, the population is being increased day to day. And the requirements of the client is also the day-to-day. So today the organization cannot afford the on-demand client requirement in a stipulated amount of time. So in this scenario, they need an alternative to over the problem. The alternative, that we have today is that application of Artificial Intelligence. Click Artificial Intelligence Online Training to know how does it solve the problem.<br>



<b><u>Need for Artificial Intelligence :</u></b><br>



Before going to know the need for Artificial Intelligence, let me first explain to you what is Artificial Intelligence?<br>



Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of the human process by machines (computer systems). These processes include the learning, reasoning, and self-correction.<br>



We need Artificial Intelligence (AI) because the work that we need to do is increasing day-to-day. So it’s a good idea to automate the routine work. This saves the manpower of the organization and also increases the productivity. Additionally, through this Artificial Intelligence, the company can also get the skilled the persons for the development of the company. Moreover the companies today think that they want to mechanize all the regular and routine work. And they think they can automate those regular works through the simple program Because, with the development of data science,  automation becomes more common. The application of this AI is majorly seen at website chat portal. You people when you come to the websites probably seen the welcome message. Then after actual conversation usually starts.<br>



So this Powerful Artificial Intelligence has divided into 4 categories. So now let me explain to you  one by one :<br>



<b>Reactive machines :</b><br>



A good example of this Reactive machines is Deep blue. And this is usually applied in Chess Board. This can identify the pieces of the chess board and make predictions. But the drawback is that it does not have memory. It means, it cannot use the past experiences to predict the future. So it just uses the current situation and just moves the pawn. It is intended for the application of a small situation. The situation could be handled within a moment itself.<br>



<b>Limited Memory :</b><br>



This type of AI is applied where there is a need for memory. Some machines work on the basis of the past experience. It means they the information of the same thing that happened in the past and does the current work accordingly. This type of AI majority used in the areas of self-driving cars. It uses its memory to act in situations like traffic collisions.<br>

<b>Theory of mind :</b><br>



This type of AI refers to the understanding of other behaviors and do the work according to It includes the feeling.  the intention, moves of the other person. In general, this kind of AI still does not exist. And today most of the scientists ware working hard to get it practically.<br>



<b>Self-awareness :</b><br>



Like the above type, this type of  Artificial Intelligence systems, need to bring practically. They think that these systems should have a self-awareness and must have a capability to understand the feeling of others<br>



So finally , I would like conclude the application Artificial Intelligence with the following figure Why do we need Artificial Intelligence<br>



<u><b>Recommended Audience :</b></u><br>

Software developers<br>



Database Administrators<br>



Team leaders<br>



System Admins<br>



Prerequisites:<br>

There is nothing much prerequisites to pursue the course. It's good to have a basic knowledge of Data science algorithms and basic knowledge of programming languages like python for the purpose of automation.</p><hr>
